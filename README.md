Sample app providing 3 functionalities : 
1 - Functionality one : Pagination ->>  a view that consumes a REST API (you can choose a free API). The view should display
a paginated list of items. Additionally, it should have a search functionality that searches a
specific parameter in the list of objects provided by the API. Upon selecting an item from the list,
the application should open a screen to display the details of the selected item.

2- Functionality two : Upper Case Converter ->> a view with an input field. The user can enter a phrase in this field. The operation to
perform on the phrase is as follows: convert the first letter of each word to uppercase and display
it on the screen. Language-specific functions such as split, capitalize, filters, etc., cannot be used.

3- Functionality three :  a view capable of generating random passwords. Passwords should be configurable with
the following parameters:
● Length: Between 5 and 20 characters.
● With or without uppercase letters.
● With or without numbers.
● With or without symbols.
